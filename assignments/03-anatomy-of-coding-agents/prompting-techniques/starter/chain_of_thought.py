"""Chain-of-thought — refund eligibility.

Task: given the refund policy and an order, decide YES or NO. Use chain-of-thought
so the model reasons step by step, but make the FINAL line exactly `DECISION: YES`
or `DECISION: NO` so it can be graded.

Only edit YOUR_SYSTEM_PROMPT.

Think step by step. For each rule in the policy below:
1. Check whether the purchase was made within the last 30 days.
2. Check whether the product is unused.
3. Check whether the product is marked as final-sale.

Then approve the refund only if all three rules are satisfied. If even one rule is violated, reject the refund. If information is missing, do not assume that the rule is satisfied. If any rule is violated, the decision must be NO, even if other information is missing.

Explain your reasoning briefly by checking each rule individually.

The LAST line of your answer must be exactly:
DECISION: YES
or
DECISION: NO
